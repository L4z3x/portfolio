## Overview

mal‑cli is a high-performance terminal interface for the official MyAnimeList API, written in Rust. It provides fast, keyboard-driven navigation across anime and manga lists in a visually sleek TUI using the Ratatui crate. Designed for efficiency, it supports GPU-enhanced terminals and works across Linux, macOS, Windows, and musl environments.

## Key Features

- **Ratatui-based TUI**: Modern, widget-driven interface with popups and keyboard navigation.

- **Easy installation**: Available on crates.io, AUR (yay -S mal-cli), Debian, Windows binaries, and via Cargo

## Technologies Used:

- **Rust**: for performance and memory safety

- **Ratatui**: Rust TUI crate

- **Tokio async runtime**: for API calls and event handling

- **Crossterm**: low-level terminal I/O

- **serde / reqwest / tokio-rustls**: for HTTP, JSON parsing, and TLS

- **Image support**: via ratatui-image for inline graphics on supported terminals

## Skills Learned:

- Building complex async Rust apps with Tokio and handling event loops

- Crafting dynamic terminal UIs using Ratatui: popups, list views, threading

- Cross-platform packaging: managing builds for Linux (AUR), Debian, Windows, and musl

- Terminal graphics: integrating image rendering in TUI-friendly terminals

- Keyboard navigation ergonomics: designing intuitive keybindings and popup flows

## Challenges and Lessons:

- Managing async events and popups required careful structuring to avoid input lag and race conditions

- Creating AUR/DPKG packages from Rust binaries taught me packaging nuances across Linux distributions

## Outcome:

- [Gained nearly 100 stars ⭐ on GitHub](https://github.com/L4z3x/mal-cli), with a solid open-source community response

- Featured on Rust forums and r/linux for delivering a sleek, native-like TUI experience
    
- Continuously released updates (latest v0.2.1 on 2025‑06‑11), with support for multiple OS targets and easy installation across platforms
